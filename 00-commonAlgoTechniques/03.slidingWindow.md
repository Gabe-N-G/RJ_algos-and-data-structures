# Sliding Window

The **sliding window technique** is a pattern used to solve problems involving **subarrays**, **substrings**, or **ranges** in arrays or strings. It involves creating a "window" of elements that slides over the data structure, expanding or shrinking as needed.

This technique is especially helpful for problems like:

1. **Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray.**
2. **Determining the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**
3. **Solving problems with a fixed or variable window size.**

## How It Works

1. Define a "window" that represents a range of elements in the data structure (e.g., a range of indices in an array or string).
2. Use two pointers (usually `left` and `right`) to manage the size and position of the window.
3. Expand the window (move the `right` pointer) to include more elements as needed.
4. Shrink the window (move the `left` pointer) when the window becomes invalid or when the problem requires reducing its size.
5. Use the elements within the window to compute the result.

## Examples of Sliding Window

### 1. Maximum Sum of a Subarray (Fixed Window)

In this example, we find the maximum sum of a subarray with a fixed size.

```javascript
function maxSubarraySum(arr, size) {
  if (arr.length < size) return null;

  let maxSum = 0,
    tempSum = 0;

  // Create the initial window
  for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    maxSum += arr[i];
  }
  tempSum = maxSum;

  // Slide the window
  for (let i = size; i < arr.length; i++) {
    tempSum = tempSum - arr[i - size] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, tempSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}

console.log(maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 2)); // 10
console.log(maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 4)); // 17
```

#### Explanation:

- A **fixed-size window** of length `size` is maintained.
- Initially, the sum of the first `size` elements is computed.
- The window is then slid across the array by removing the first element of the previous window and adding the next element.
- The maximum sum of all windows is returned.

### 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Variable Window)

In this example, we find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters using a dynamic window size.

```javascript
function longestUniqueSubstring(s) {
  let seen = new Set(),
    left = 0,
    maxLength = 0;

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (seen.has(s[right])) {
      seen.delete(s[left]); // Remove the leftmost character to shrink the window
      left++;
    }
    seen.add(s[right]); // Add the current character to the window
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1); // Update max length
  }

  return maxLength;
}

console.log(longestUniqueSubstring("abcabcbb")); // 3
console.log(longestUniqueSubstring("bbbbb")); // 1
```

#### Explanation:

- A **variable-size window** is maintained using two pointers (`left` and `right`).
- The `seen` set is used to track the unique characters in the current window.
- If a duplicate character is encountered, the window is shrunk by incrementing `left` until the duplicate is removed.
- The length of the window (`right - left + 1`) is tracked to find the maximum length.

### Why Use the Sliding Window Technique?

The sliding window technique is incredibly efficient for problems involving contiguous elements in arrays or strings because:

1. **Reduced Complexity:**  
   Instead of using a nested loop to check all possible subarrays or substrings (which would result in `O(n^2)` time complexity), the sliding window reduces this to `O(n)` by dynamically expanding and shrinking the window.

2. **Space Efficiency:**  
   It typically uses `O(1)` or `O(k)` additional space (e.g., to store the current window or a frequency map), depending on the problem.

3. **Intuitive Framework:**  
   Problems with fixed or dynamic ranges often map naturally to this technique.

The sliding window is a **go-to tool** for many substring, subarray, and range-based problems in competitive programming and interview scenarios.
