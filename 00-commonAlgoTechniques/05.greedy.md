# Greedy Strategy

The **greedy strategy** is a problem-solving technique that builds a solution step by step by selecting the **best available option** at each step, without considering the global picture. The goal is to make a series of **locally optimal choices**, hoping that these lead to a **globally optimal solution**.

Greedy algorithms are widely used in **optimization problems**, where the objective is to maximize or minimize a value (e.g., shortest path, maximum profit, minimum cost). However, greedy algorithms do not always guarantee the best solution for all problems. Their success depends on the **structure of the problem** and whether the problem satisfies certain properties.

## Key Characteristics of Problems Solved with Greedy Algorithms

1. **Greedy Choice Property:**  
   A globally optimal solution can be achieved by making a series of locally optimal choices.

   - **Example:** In **Dijkstra’s algorithm**, choosing the shortest edge at each step leads to the shortest path.

2. **Optimal Substructure:**  
   The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and solving each subproblem optimally leads to an optimal solution for the entire problem.
   - **Example:** In **Kruskal’s algorithm**, finding the minimum spanning tree involves repeatedly solving the problem for subsets of edges.

If a problem satisfies both of these properties, it is a strong candidate for a greedy algorithm.

### Examples

#### 1. Coin Change Problem

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
  coins.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sort coins in descending order
  let count = 0;

  for (let coin of coins) {
    while (amount >= coin) {
      amount -= coin;
      count++;
    }
  }

  return amount === 0 ? count : -1;
}

console.log(coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11)); // 3
console.log(coinChange([2], 3)); // -1
```

#### 2. Interval Scheduling (Non-Overlapping Intervals)

```javascript
function maxNonOverlappingIntervals(intervals) {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]); // Sort by end time
  let count = 0,
    end = -Infinity;

  for (let [start, finish] of intervals) {
    if (start >= end) {
      count++;
      end = finish;
    }
  }

  return count;
}

console.log(
  maxNonOverlappingIntervals([
    [1, 2],
    [2, 3],
    [3, 4],
    [1, 3],
  ])
); // 3
console.log(
  maxNonOverlappingIntervals([
    [1, 2],
    [1, 2],
    [1, 2],
  ])
); // 1
```

## Benefits of Greedy Algorithms

1. **Efficiency:**  
   Greedy algorithms are often faster than exhaustive approaches like dynamic programming because they don’t explore all possible solutions.

2. **Simplicity:**  
   Greedy algorithms are usually easy to implement and understand.

---

## Limitations of Greedy Algorithms

1. **May Fail to Find Optimal Solutions:**  
   Greedy algorithms may fail to find the optimal solution for problems that don’t satisfy the greedy choice property or optimal substructure.

   - **Example:** For certain versions of the **knapsack problem**, a greedy algorithm can fail to find the optimal solution.

2. **Problem-Specific:**  
   A greedy approach works only when the problem guarantees that the **locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution**.

## Types of Problems That Use Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are commonly used in the following types of problems:

1. **Pathfinding Problems:**

   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

2. **Graph Problems:**

   - **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by adding edges with the least weight.
   - **Prim's Algorithm:** Another algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.

3. **Scheduling Problems:**

   - **Activity Selection Problem:** Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
   - **Interval Scheduling:** Find the maximum number of mutually compatible intervals.

4. **Compression Problems:**

   - **Huffman Coding:** A greedy compression algorithm that generates variable-length codes for characters based on frequency.

5. **Change-Making Problem:**  
   Determine the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount (using denominations in descending order).

6. **Fractional Knapsack Problem:**  
   Maximizes the total value of items that can be carried, allowing fractional parts of items.

## Why Use Greedy Algorithms?

1. **Faster Execution:**  
   Greedy algorithms usually work in linear or `O(n log n)` time, making them more efficient than dynamic programming for some problems.

2. **Elegant Simplicity:**  
   Their implementation often requires fewer steps and less memory compared to exhaustive methods like backtracking or dynamic programming.

However, it is crucial to **analyze the problem carefully** before applying a greedy algorithm, as they may not always yield the correct solution if the problem’s structure doesn’t fit the greedy paradigm.
