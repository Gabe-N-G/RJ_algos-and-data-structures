# List of Common Algorithm Techniques

Below is a list of common techniques used in algorithm design and problem-solving:

1. Two-Pointer Technique
2. Sliding Window
3. Divide and Conquer
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Greedy Algorithm
6. Backtracking
7. Binary Search
8. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
9. Depth-First Search (DFS)
10. Topological Sorting
11. Bit Manipulation
12. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
13. Kadane's Algorithm (for maximum subarray problems)
14. Segment Tree (or Fenwick Tree)
15. Trie (Prefix Tree)
16. Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
17. Heap (Priority Queue)
18. Hashing (Hash Maps and Hash Sets)
19. Sorting Techniques (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
20. Mathematical Techniques (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes, Modular Arithmetic)
21. Recursion
22. Monotonic Stack/Queue
23. Flood Fill Algorithm
24. Knapsack Problem (0/1 and Unbounded)
25. Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum

These techniques can solve a wide range of problems across arrays, strings, graphs, trees, dynamic programming, and more.
