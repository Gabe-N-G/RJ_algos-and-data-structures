# Substring Matching

The **substring matching technique** is used to find one or more occurrences of a **substring (or pattern)** within a larger string. It can range from simple **brute-force approaches** to more advanced algorithms like **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** or **Rabin-Karp**.

This technique is commonly applied in problems involving:

1. Searching for patterns within text.
2. Counting occurrences of substrings.
3. Validating whether a substring exists in a larger string.

## Examples of Substring Matching

### 1. Brute-Force Substring Search

The brute-force approach slides a window of the same length as the substring (`needle`) across the larger string (`haystack`) and compares the characters at each step.

```javascript
function substringSearch(haystack, needle) {
  for (let i = 0; i <= haystack.length - needle.length; i++) {
    if (haystack.slice(i, i + needle.length) === needle) {
      return i; // Return the starting index of the first occurrence
    }
  }
  return -1; // No match found
}

console.log(substringSearch("hello", "ll")); // 2
console.log(substringSearch("aaaaa", "bba")); // -1
```

#### Explanation:

- A **fixed-size window** (equal to the length of `needle`) is slid across `haystack`.
- At each step, the substring within the window is compared to `needle`.
- If a match is found, the starting index of the window is returned.
- If no match is found after scanning the entire string, return `-1`.

#### Time Complexity:

- Worst Case: `O(n * m)`

Where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`.
This is because for every starting position in `haystack`, up to `m` characters are compared.

#### Space Complexity:

`O(1)` â€” No additional space is used apart from variables.

### Advanced Substring Matching Algorithms

While the brute-force approach works, it can be inefficient for larger inputs. More advanced algorithms like **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** and **Rabin-Karp**, which we will cover later, optimize substring matching:

---

#### **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP):**

- **How It Works:**  
   KMP preprocesses the pattern (substring) to create a **partial match table** (or prefix table). This table allows the algorithm to skip unnecessary comparisons when a mismatch occurs by reusing information about previous matches.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Preprocessing: `O(m)`
  - Searching: `O(n)`  
    (where `n` is the length of the main string, and `m` is the length of the pattern).

#### **Rabin-Karp:**

- **How It Works:**  
   Rabin-Karp uses a **hash function** to compute a hash for the substring and compare it to hashes of substrings in the larger string. If the hashes match, it checks the actual characters to verify the match. This is particularly useful for searching for **multiple patterns** in a single pass.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Average Case: `O(n + m)`
  - Worst Case: `O(n * m)` (due to hash collisions).

---

These advanced techniques reduce the worst-case time complexity to **`O(n + m)`** for single pattern matching, making them significantly more efficient than brute-force for large inputs.

### Applications of Substring Matching

Substring matching is foundational in fields like:

- **Text Processing:** Searching for keywords in large bodies of text (e.g., plagiarism detection).
- **Compilers:** Parsing and pattern matching in source code.
- **Search Engines:** Finding exact or partial matches in indexed data.

These algorithms are essential for solving many real-world problems efficiently and at scale.
