# List of Common Algorithm Techniques

Below is a list of common techniques used in algorithm design and problem-solving:

- Frequency Counter
- Two-Pointer Technique
- Sliding Window
- Substring Matching
- Greedy Algorithm
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Topological Sorting
- Bit Manipulation
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- Kadane's Algorithm (for maximum subarray problems)
- Segment Tree (or Fenwick Tree)
- Trie (Prefix Tree)
- Graph Traversal and Shortest Path Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- Heap (Priority Queue)
- Hashing (Hash Maps and Hash Sets)
- Sorting Techniques (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Mathematical Techniques (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes, Modular Arithmetic)
- Recursion
- Monotonic Stack/Queue
- Flood Fill Algorithm
- Knapsack Problem (0/1 and Unbounded)
- Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum

These techniques can solve a wide range of problems across arrays, strings, graphs, trees, dynamic programming, and mor0.
