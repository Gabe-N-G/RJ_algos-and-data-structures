# Dynamic Programming

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. Instead of solving the same subproblem multiple times, dynamic programming stores the results of these subproblems (using a table, array, or other data structures) and reuses them when needed. This approach is known as **memoization** (top-down) or **tabulation** (bottom-up).

Dynamic programming is particularly useful for problems involving:

1. **Optimization** (e.g., finding the shortest path, maximum profit, etc.).
2. **Counting** (e.g., counting the number of ways to reach a goal).
3. **Decision making** (e.g., deciding the best way to divide a resource).

## Key Characteristics of Dynamic Programming Problems

1. **Optimal Substructure:**  
   A problem has optimal substructure if the solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the solutions of its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems:**  
   A problem has overlapping subproblems if it can be broken into subproblems that are solved multiple times.

## How It Works

Dynamic Programming works in two ways:

1. **Top-Down (Memoization):**

   - Solve the problem recursively.
   - Use a cache (or memoization table) to store solutions to subproblems so they don't have to be recomputed.

2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**
   - Solve the problem iteratively.
   - Build up the solution to the problem starting from the base cases.

## Examples of Dynamic Programming

### 1. Fibonacci Numbers (Memoization)

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a problem that can be optimized using dynamic programming. Without memoization, the recursive solution has exponential time complexity.

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  if (n in memo) return memo[n]; // Check if result is already computed

  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo); // Store result in memo
  return memo[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
console.log(fibonacci(50)); // 12586269025
```

Here, memoization prevents redundant calculations by storing the Fibonacci numbers that have already been computed.

### 2. Climbing Stairs (Tabulation)

You are climbing a staircase with `n` steps. You can climb either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways can you reach the top?

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return n;

  const dp = new Array(n + 1);
  dp[1] = 1;
  dp[2] = 2;

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Use previously calculated steps
  }

  return dp[n];
}

console.log(climbStairs(5)); // 8
console.log(climbStairs(10)); // 89
```

In this example, the `dp` array stores the number of ways to reach each step, avoiding redundant calculations.

### 3. Longest Common Subsequence (Memoization)

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
  const memo = {};

  function lcs(i, j) {
    if (i === text1.length || j === text2.length) return 0;
    const key = `${i},${j}`;
    if (key in memo) return memo[key];

    if (text1[i] === text2[j]) {
      memo[key] = 1 + lcs(i + 1, j + 1);
    } else {
      memo[key] = Math.max(lcs(i + 1, j), lcs(i, j + 1));
    }
    return memo[key];
  }

  return lcs(0, 0);
}

console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abcde", "ace")); // 3 ("ace")
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "def")); // 0
```

Here, memoization avoids recalculating overlapping subproblems by storing the results of subproblems indexed by `(i, j)`.

### 4. 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Tabulation)

You are given `n` items, each with a weight and value, and a maximum capacity `W`. Find the maximum value you can achieve without exceeding the capacity.

```javascript
function knapsack(values, weights, W) {
  const n = values.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(W + 1).fill(0));

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
      if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(
          dp[i - 1][w],
          dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]
        );
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[n][W];
}

console.log(knapsack([60, 100, 120], [10, 20, 30], 50)); // 220
```

This example demonstrates how the DP table is used to iteratively build the solution to the knapsack problem.

## Why Dynamic Programming is Powerful

### Efficiency:

- Dynamic programming reduces the time complexity of problems with overlapping subproblems, often turning exponential algorithms into polynomial ones.

### Scalability:

- DP is scalable and handles large problem sizes efficiently, as it avoids redundant calculations.

### Optimal Solutions:

- DP guarantees an optimal solution for problems with optimal substructure, making it a go-to technique for optimization problems.

## Common Problems Solved with Dynamic Programming

2. Climbing Stairs
3. Longest Common Subsequence
4. Longest Increasing Subsequence
5. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
6. Partition Equal Subset Sum

### Final Note:

Dynamic programming can be challenging at first but becomes intuitive with practice. Focus on identifying **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure** to recognize when a problem can be solved with DP.
